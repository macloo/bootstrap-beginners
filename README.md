# Bootstrap beginners

This is a small repo for students who are just starting to use Bootstrap.

**DO NOT fork this repo** for your assignment.

*without.html* is a file copied from our textbook, Robbins Chapter 9. It contains the complete form shown in examples in the chapter.

*with_bootstrap.html* is the same Robbins file, but with changes made to add Bootstrap. The form elements are recoded to use the Bootstrap styles.

*rays_chapter_5.html* is a file copied from “Bootstrap 3 Essential Training with Ray Villalobos” at Lynda.com. This is the file he starts with, then modifies, in the first video in chapter 5.

*basic_bootstrap_template.html* is a very small file with the Bootstrap files linked in, and a container DIV, but nothing else.

Use the files here to see how things are set up for Bootstrap.
