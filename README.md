# Bootstrap beginners

This is a small repo for students who are just starting to use Bootstrap.

**DO NOT fork this repo** for your assignment.

[*without.html*](http://macloo.github.io/bootstrap-beginners/without.html) is a file copied from our textbook, Robbins Chapter 9. It contains the complete form shown in examples in the chapter.

[*with_bootstrap.html*](http://macloo.github.io/bootstrap-beginners/with_bootstrap.html.html) is the same Robbins file, but with changes made to add Bootstrap. The form elements are recoded to use the Bootstrap styles.

[*rays_chapter_5.html*](http://macloo.github.io/bootstrap-beginners/rays_chapter_5.html) is a file copied from “Bootstrap 3 Essential Training with Ray Villalobos” at Lynda.com. This is the file he starts with, then modifies, in the first video in chapter 5.

[*basic_bootstrap_template.html*](http://macloo.github.io/bootstrap-beginners/basic_bootstrap_template.html) is a very small file with the Bootstrap files linked in, and a container DIV, but nothing else.

Use the files here to see how things are set up for using Bootstrap.
